    <!-- Alt attribute -->

<!-- Besides the src attribute, every image element must also have an alt (alternative text) attribute. -->

<!-- The alt attribute is used to describe an image. 
    It will be used in place of the image if it cannot be loaded. 
    It is also used with screen readers to describe what the image is to visually impaired users.

<!-- While not strictly required, specifying height and width attributes 
    in image tags helps the browser layout the page without causing the page to jump and flash.

It is a good habit to always specify these attributes on every image, 
even when the image is the correct size or you are using CSS to modify it. -->


    <br>To use images that we have on our own websites, we can use a relative path. <br>

    Create a new directory named images within the odin-links-and-images project. <br>

    Next, download this image and move it into the images directory we just created. <br>

    Rename the image to dog.jpg. <br>

Finally add the image to the index.html file:
