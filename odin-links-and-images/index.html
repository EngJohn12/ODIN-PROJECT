    <p>Anchor elements

        To create a link in HTML, we use the anchor element. <br>
        An anchor element is defined by wrapping the text or <br>
        another HTML element we want to be a link with an "a"tag.
        
        Add the following to the body of the index.html page <br>
        we created and open it in the browser:</p>

    <a>click me</a><br><br><br>

    <!-- You may have noticed that clicking this link doesn’t do anything. 
        This is because an anchor tag on its own won’t know where we want to link to. 
        We have to tell it a destination to go to. We do this by using an HTML attribute. -->

<!-- An HTML attribute gives additional information to an HTML element and always goes in the element’s opening tag. 
    An attribute is usually made up of two parts: a name, and a value; however, not all attributes require a value. 
    In our case, we need to add a href (hypertext reference) attribute to the opening anchor tag. 
    The value of the href attribute is the destination we want our link to go to. -->

<!-- Add the following href attribute to the anchor element we created previously and try clicking it again, 
    don’t forget to refresh the browser so the new changes can be applied.  -->


    <br><br><br><br>


    <!-- By default, any text wrapped with an anchor tag without a href attribute will look like plain text. 
        If the href attribute is present, 
        the browser will give the text a blue color and underline it to signify it is a link -->
        

        <!-- It’s worth noting you can use anchor tags to link to any kind of resource on the internet, 
            not just other HTML documents. You can link to videos, pdf files, images, and so on, but for the most part, 
            you will be linking to other HTML documents. -->
